SymfonyCasts Harmonious Development with Symfony 6
======================

During this course, I gained hands-on experience with Symfony, learning to create and manage projects using the Symfony CLI tool.

I worked extensively with routes and controllers, understanding how to map URLs to controller methods and return responses. I implemented dynamic URL parameters with wildcard routes and learned to handle optional wildcards and string manipulations.

Symfony Flex was a key area of learning, simplifying the installation of packages and dependencies, including Twig for HTML rendering. I learned the Twig syntax for templating, including variable printing, iteration, conditional statements, and template inheritance.

Debugging and performance analysis were enhanced using the Symfony Profiler and web debug toolbar, providing detailed insights into requests and system performance.

I adopted Webpack Encore for managing frontend assets, efficiently packaging and minifying CSS and JavaScript. I integrated third-party libraries into the project.

Enhancing JavaScript capabilities with Stimulus, I created interactive front-end experiences, using controllers and binding actions to HTML elements for dynamic functionality. Axios was used for asynchronous requests, enabling real-time data interactions.

Lastly, I explored Turbo to optimize application performance, converting link clicks and form submissions into AJAX calls for a seamless user experience.

This comprehensive course helped me refresh the basics of Symfony.
